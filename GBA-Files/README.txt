On the Welcome Screen, You can click enter/return to start to play the game. This game is actually a spin off on the world's hardest game. 
The player can use the arrow keys to move left/right and up/down. In order to win, the player must collect all 3 coins without getting hit
by the enemies. If hit by the enenmy, the player will be redirected to a losing screen and upon collecting the 3 coins, the player will be 
redirected to the winning screen. On both screens, the player can click backspace/select key to return back to the start screen to play 
the game again. The player can also click the select/backspace key at any time during the game to reset the game to play again as well.
